# Legacy Archive - Deprecated Code

⚠️ **DEPRECATED - FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY** ⚠️

This folder contains legacy UI code that has been replaced by the modern SimpleGameOver system as of June 2025.

## What's in this archive:
- `2025-06-ui-refactor/` - Legacy game over and menu card systems
  - `game-over-sequence.js` - Old complex game over flow
  - `game-menu-card.js/css` - Legacy menu card components
  - `EverythingCard.js` - Old unified card system

## Why it was replaced:
- Overly complex and hard to maintain
- Poor user experience with confusing flows
- Not integrated with modern backend systems
- Inconsistent UI/UX patterns

## Current implementation:
See `games/neondrop/ui/SimpleGameOver.js` for the modern, clean replacement.

## ⚠️ DO NOT USE
