#### **BlockZoneTournament Contract**
```solidity
contract BlockZoneTournament {
    struct Championship {
        uint256 id;
        uint256 startTime;
        uint256 endTime;
        uint256 entryFee;
        uint256 prizePool;
        mapping(address => uint256) scores;
        address[] participants;
        bool isActive;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Championship) public championships;
    uint256 public championshipCount;
    
    function createChampionship(uint256 duration, uint256 entryFee) external onlyOwner;
    function joinChampionship(uint256 championshipId) external payable;

    function endChampionship(uint256 championshipId) external onlyOwner;
    function claimPrize(uint256 championshipId) external;
}
```

#### **BlockZoneChallenges Contract**
```solidity

    function claimWinnings(uint256 challengeId) external;
}
```

### **Deterministic Replay System**

#### **Game State Recording**
```javascript
class DeterministicRecorder {
    constructor() {
        this.seed = this.generateSeed();
        this.actions = [];
        this.checkpoints = [];
        this.startTime = Date.now();
    }
    
    recordAction(action, frameCount) {
        this.actions.push({
            type: action.type,
            data: action.data,
            frame: frameCount,
            timestamp: Date.now() - this.startTime
        });
    }
    
    recordCheckpoint(state) {
        this.checkpoints.push({
            frame: this.actions.length,
            stateHash: this.hashState(state),
            timestamp: Date.now() - this.startTime
        });
    }
    
    generateProof() {
        return {
            seed: this.seed,
            actions: this.compressActions(this.actions),
            checkpoints: this.checkpoints,
            merkleRoot: this.calculateMerkleRoot(),
            finalScore: this.finalScore,
            duration: Date.now() - this.startTime
        };
    }
}
```

### **Anti-Cheat Validation**

#### **Server-Side Verification**
```javascript
class AntiCheatValidator {
    async validateGame(proof) {
        // Replay the game with same seed
        const replayedGame = await this.replayGame(proof.seed, proof.actions);
        
        // Verify final state matches
        if (replayedGame.finalScore !== proof.finalScore) {
            throw new Error('Score mismatch detected');
        }
        
        // Check for impossible actions
        const impossibleActions = this.detectImpossibleActions(proof.actions);
        if (impossibleActions.length > 0) {
            throw new Error('Impossible actions detected');
        }
        
        // Verify timing consistency
        const timingAnomalies = this.analyzeTiming(proof.actions);
        if (timingAnomalies.score > 0.8) {
            throw new Error('Suspicious timing patterns');
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
