# BlockZone Lab: Viral Gaming Platform

## Current Status
✅ **Preserved Assets:**
- Neon Drop gameplay mechanics, physics, visuals, and controls (exactly as original)
- Educational platform components
- Game aesthetics and user experience

❌ **Critical Issues to Fix:**
- Broken KV storage and session management
- Player identity and authentication problems
- No revenue systems implemented
- No championship cycles or friend challenges

## ACTION PLAN - Phase 1: Core Platform

### Priority 1: Fix Broken Infrastructure
1. **Rebuild Session Management**
   - Fix player authentication and persistent sessions
   - Implement proper user identity system
   - Restore KV storage functionality

2. **Payment System Foundation**
   - Implement USDC.E integration on Sonic Labs blockchain
   - Create wallet connection and authentication
   - Build 90%/10% split system (winner gets 90%, platform gets 10%)

### Priority 2: Revenue Systems
3. **Championship Cycles**
   - Two 12-hour championships daily (12 AM-12 PM GMT, 12 PM-12 AM GMT)
   - Players pay 25¢ (quarters) per attempt
   - Real-time leaderboards with Sonic Labs validation
   - Championship finale system with dramatic freeze effects

4. **Friend Challenges**
   - Auto-generated challenge links: `blockzonelab.com/challenge/[username]/[score]`
   - One-tap Apple Pay/Google Pay integration
   - Viral challenge flow: "Beat [score] for 25¢!"

### Priority 3: User Experience
5. **Main Interface**
   - Two clear primary buttons: "CHAMPIONSHIP" and "CHALLENGE FRIEND"
   - Clean Apple-inspired minimalism with 80s arcade flair
   - Use Neon Drop's neon colors as platform accent palette
   - Mobile-responsive design

6. **Navigation & Design**
   - Uniform navigation system on every page
   - Professional file structure for rapid game scaling
   - Shared design system across platform

### Priority 4: Engagement Features
7. **Streak System**
   - Friend challenge streak tracking
   - 3-day streak = 2 free championship attempts
   - 7-day streak = 3 free championship attempts

8. **Championship Finale**
   - All games freeze at championship end time
   - Dramatic freeze effect with neon particles
   - Live leaderboard updates
   - 15-second victory celebration
   - Immediate prize distribution

## Technical Architecture

### Modular System Design
- Shared design system, payments, and scoring across all games
- Professional file structure for easy addition of 4-5+ games
- Unified CSS design system throughout entire platform

### Payment & Tokenomics
- **Entry Fees:** 25¢ (quarters) in USDC.E per attempt
- **Prize Pool:** 90% of entry fees go to prizes, 10% to platform
- **Display:** "25¢ in USDC.E (US Dollars)" or "Quarters (USDC.E - US Dollars)"
- **Education:** "USDC.E is just US Dollars that work on the blockchain"

### Data Storage
- KV storage for user profiles, streaks, scores, payment history
- Real-time anti-cheat validation built into Web3 scoring system
- Persistent player sessions and authentication

## Development Phases

### Phase 1 (Current): Core Platform
- Fix broken infrastructure
- Implement championship cycles and friend challenges
- Build payment and authentication systems
- Create main user interface

- Advanced tournament systems

## Original Vision
Transform BlockZone Lab into a viral, quarters-based gaming platform with two main revenue systems while maintaining the educational platform components. The Neon Drop game should play identically to how it currently works - only improve the code quality and organization underneath.
