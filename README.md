# BlockZone Lab: Leaderboards & Prize Distribution

## Vision & Feature Summary

### Leaderboards & Prizes

- **Daily Leaderboard**
  - Resets every 12 hours (AM/PM cycles)
  - Top 5 players win prizes
  - Hyperbolic prize distribution: 1st gets 40%, 2nd–5th share the rest (with $5 minimums)
  - 90% of entry fees go to prizes, 10% to platform

- **All-Time Leaderboard**
  - Never resets
  - Legacy "Hall of Fame" for the highest scores ever
  - Purely for prestige and long-term motivation

- **Saturday Bounty Boss Jackpot**
  - Each Saturday, a "Bounty Boss" score is set (last week's top score)
  - Beat the Bounty Boss on Saturday to win the entire jackpot (accumulated from unclaimed jackpots)
  - If no one beats it, the jackpot rolls over and grows for the next week
  - Simple, high-stakes, and viral

### Simplicity-First Philosophy
- All rules are clear, direct, and easy to understand
- No unnecessary complexity—features are added only if they enhance fun, fairness, or viral growth
